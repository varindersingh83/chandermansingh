Claymorphism can make interfaces feel tactile, but it needs constraints to stay usable.

## Start with subtle contrast

Keep your surface and background close, then create depth with dual shadows.

```css
.card {
  border-radius: 1.75rem;
  background: #f4f5f8;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px #d2d5db, -10px -10px 20px #ffffff;
}
```

## Add state clarity

Use lifted shadows for default controls and inset shadows for pressed states. This reinforces interaction without heavy animation.

## Keep typography crisp

With soft surfaces, text contrast carries hierarchy. Use an ink color with enough luminance difference for readability.
