A designer portfolio needs publishing speed. Astro content collections keep the workflow predictable.

## Why MDX works well

MDX supports narrative text, code, and embedded components in one file. That makes technical case studies easier to publish.

## Keep metadata strict

Define schema with `zod` in `src/content/config.ts` so every post has title, date, and description.

## Build confidence with static routes

Generate blog detail pages using `getStaticPaths` and render content at build time.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.id }, props: { post } }));
}
```
